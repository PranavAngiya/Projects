Additional information about our project:
- Reserve price is an optional field when creating an auction.
- Our clothing items are strictly of four types: Shirt, Belt, Pant, and Shoe.

We began implementing our Clothing auction site with a login page, and created three seperate types of accounts: End-users, admin, and customer representatives. 
We further split our tasks amongst our group members, giving each member a specific functionality to focus on. For example, one group member focused on implementing 
functionalities for the bidding system, the other focused on question and answer functionalities, and the third focused on sales/earnings functionalities. Throughout 
the process of creating this project, we acknowledged and learned about the intricacies of programming an application with SQL queries. More specifically, we learned to
appreciate the ease and efficiency that SQL provides to a program. It additionally provides a dynamic way to coordinate between the client, server, and data.

Any user of the website will be able to create a auction and post relevant information to the auction. These auctions can have an automatic bidding system allowing the bidder to set a max price and forget about the auction. They will recieve a notice if their upper limit has been reached, allowing them to place another bid if neccesary. All requirements from the checklist have been met and can be experimented with by using the source code provided.
